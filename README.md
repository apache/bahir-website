Apache Bahir Website
====================

The Apache Bahir website was forked from the [Apache Website Template](https://github.com/apache/apache-website-template).

The website gets generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

How to deploy your project's web site
=====================================

Installing Jekyll and website dependencies
------------------------------------------

The steps below will install the latest [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) version and any dependencies required to get this website built.

```
1. sudo gem install jekyll bundler
2. cd site
3. sudo bundle install
```

For more information, see [Installing Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Running locally
---------------

Before opening a pull request, you can preview your contributions by running from within the directory:

```
1. cd site
2. bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
3. Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
```

Update extensions documentation
-------------------------------

To update the current documentation contents, use the update-doc script. This script will update the documentation contents based on the README.md files from the source of each extension.

```
1. update-doc.sh
2. git commit -a -m "My updates"
3. git push
4. ./publish.sh
5. git push origin asf-site
```

Publishing to live site
-----------------------

Bahir is using [gitpubsub](http://www.apache.org/dev/gitpubsub.html) for publishing the website, and the live website content is stored in the asf-site git branch.

To publish new contents to the website, commit your changes to master, and use the 'publish.sh' shell script.

```
1. Make your changes
2. git commit -a -m "My updates"
3. git push
4. ./publish.sh
5. git push origin asf-site
```

Within a few minutes, gitpubsub should kick in and you'll be able to see the results at [bahir.apache.org](https://bahir.apache.org/).

Adding contributors
-------------------

To add a contributor to the project, or to modify existing contributors, edit `site/_data/contributors.yml`. The [project members](http://localhost:4000/community-members) list will be re-generated.
